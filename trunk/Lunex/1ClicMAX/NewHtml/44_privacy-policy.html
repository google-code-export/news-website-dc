                	<h1>LUNEX TELECOM, INC. WEBSITE’S PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
                    <p><strong>Lunex Telecom, Inc.</strong> ("Lunex") is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Privacy Policy applies to Lunex websites and governs data collection and usage at all Lunex sites and services. Please read the complete Privacy Policy below and also click the links following this paragraph to learn additional details about how some of Lunex services protect your personal information.</p>
                    <p>Lunex has agreed to notify you of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website</li>
                        <li>Which organization is collecting this information</li>
                        <li>How the information is used</li>
                        <li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
                        <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information</li>
                        <li>The kind of security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Lunex's control</li>
                        <li>How you can correct inaccuracies in the information</li>
                        <li>Collection of your Personal Information</li>
                        <li>Lunex does not associate sensitive data, such as your race, religion, or political affiliations, with personally identifiable information. Lunex takes precautions to segregate any sensitive data you may provide on Lunex sites and services that reference your race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or political affiliations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lunex encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from <a href="http://lunextelecom.com/">lunextelecom.com</a> so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Lunex is not responsible for the privacy policy or other content on websites outside of the Lunex family of web sites.</p>
                    <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>Lunex secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Lunex secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.</p>
                    <h2>Use of customer information</h2>
                    <p>There may be information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Lunex and may be shared with other web sites within the Lunex family of web sites. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Lunex for the purpose of providing service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Lunex websites.</p>
                    <p>Lunex websites and their operational service partners collect and use your personal information to operate Lunex websites and deliver the services you have requested. Lunex sites also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Lunex and its affiliates through form such as and not limit to email, physical mail, and newsletters. Lunex may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
                    <p>Lunex will not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Lunex may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Lunex may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Lunex, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
                    <p>Lunex keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit in order to determine what Lunex services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Lunex to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
                    <p>Lunex websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Lunex or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Lunex, a Lunex web site; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of its web sites, or the public.</p>
                    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Many of the Lunex websites or pages use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Lunex's pages, or register with Lunex sites or services, a cookie helps Lunex to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Lunex website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Lunex features that you customized.</p>
                    <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Lunex services or websites you visit.</p>
                    <h2>Use of Web Beacons</h2>
                    <p>Lunex web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Lunex to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co- branded services. Lunex may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or Lunex Newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the Lunex network of sites and services; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about Lunex web site usage.</p>
                    <p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Lunex web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help Lunex determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.</p>
                    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
                    <p>Lunex welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy. If you believe that Lunex has not adhered to this Policy, please contact Lunex by telephone, e-mail, or postal mail to:</p>
